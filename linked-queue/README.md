# Linked Queue in C

This project implements a **generic linked queue** in C with full memory safety and internal invariant checks using `assert`.

## Features

- Enqueue and dequeue strings
- Generic pointer-based design (`void *`)
- Internal consistency checks
- Input-driven demo with interactive queue behavior

## Example Use

```bash
gcc -o linked_queue linked_queue.c
./linked_queue
