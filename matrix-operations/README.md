# Matrix Operations in C

This project implements **matrix addition** and **matrix multiplication** in C, with strict dimension checking and memory safety.

---

## Features

- Dynamic allocation of matrix structs
- Clean separation of dimension checking and operations
- Safe memory cleanup if allocation fails
- Multiplication uses standard dot product logic

---

## Usage

These functions are written to be included in a larger program with I/O or testing framework. They assume that the matrices have been correctly allocated and initialized before use.
